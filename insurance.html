            <h2>Project Overview</h2></br>

            <p> <span> Product:</span> Insurance sales website for lawyers. The website is structured for
                client access
                only on
                the
                Landing Page (other pages
                are accessible only for purchasing the product).</br>
                </br>The products offered on the website include
                compensation in the event
                of missed deadlines, material damages, coverage of legal costs, support in out-of-court
                settlements,
                and
                image
                restoration in situations of negative exposure.</br></br>

                <span>Products offered:</span> </br>Simplified contracting - no risk assessment required for
                inclusion;
                lawyers
                receive
                coverage of
                R$100,000.

                </br>Coverage for larger amounts - R$300,000, R$500,000, and R$1 million - is subject to
                risk
                approval.</br></br>

                            <li> <span>Navagation</span> - Navigation bar with links that only led to the same page,
                                lack of company presentation and description
                                "About page" (which diminishes credibility), only a barely visible contact link on the
                                page (only via WhatsApp link)
                                no other access points to the team available (such as email and company address). </br>
                                The

                            <li><span> Accessibility</span> - Despite the use of contrasting colors (black and white),
                                the size and grouping of the letters make it difficult to read for
                                people with visual impairments (whether permanent, such as nearsightedness, or
                                temporary, such as sensitivity to
                                sunlight).</br> Additionally, there is no Alternative Text in the website code to
                                facilitate the reading of images by
                                screen reader programs.
                            </li></br>

                            <li><span> Sad images</span> - The company tries to connect with users' pain points by
                                highlighting potential issues that can be remedied with the
                                product's coverage, featuring numerous images of sad and worried lawyers. There's no
                                equal effort to convey the
                                well-being the product can generate, and it also fails to convey the company's mission:
                                to help its clients become
                                confident and successful lawyers.
                            </li></br>
                            <li><span>Section Layout and Distribution</span> - Although the company offers four
                                insurance packages, all links lead only to the
                                simplified insurance plan, with no mention of the broader coverage options (just a small
                                section at the bottom of the
                                page). The content is distributed in text without visual appeal and striking phrases.

            <h2>Understanding the user:</h2>

            <p>
                For this project, only secondary research was conducted, searching for insurance website templates for
                lawyers and
                immersing ourselves in the legal world by accessing lawyer profiles on public platforms such as
                LinkedIn, Instagram, and
                law firms.
                </br></br>
                The use of sober and bold colors was noted to demonstrate and convey a sense of security and clarity—the
                way justice
                should be felt.

                It was also noted that the company's primary focus is on simplified coverage, often accessed by young
                people and recent
                graduates.
                </br></br>
                However, other sales packages could be geared toward more mature professionals with greater
                responsibilities. The
                strategy of opening a dialogue with these professionals was also presented.

                    practice. He currently handles cases alone.
                    João has been expanding his client base and is concerned that the backlog could cause delays
                    and

                    documentation. Currently,
                    the firm has been receiving cases from companies with significant social media coverage.

                    <p>In addition to showcasing the best-selling product — simplified hiring —, more space was proposed
                        for other products,
                        encouraging other audiences to identify with and access the company.</p>
                </li></br></br>
                <li><span>Inclusion of pages</span>
                    <p>
                        Proposal to include "About" and "Contact" pages (available in the
                        Navigation Bar) for greater user access to
                        company information (maintaining the
                        WhatsApp
                        link upon customer request). This gives customers more confidence to close the deal by gaining a
                        deeper understanding of
                        the company they will be hiring and expanding contact options, including various information:
                        company history, email
                        (formal contact information), address (physical contact information), social media (Instagram,
                        LinkedIn, etc.), among
                        others.</p>
                </li></br></br>
                <span>Accessibility</span>
                <p> The new design provides accessibility by offering two color themes (light and dark) for people with
                    visual impairments
                    (whether temporary, such as post-sun sensitivity, or permanent, such as those with low vision) or
                    even
                    based on user
                    preference. It also features larger fonts, smaller text sizes, and a focus on communicating the
                    message
                    objectively and
                    simply. The use of alternative text for screen reader applications and user-friendly code for
                    accessibility programs is
                    proposed.</p></br></br>
